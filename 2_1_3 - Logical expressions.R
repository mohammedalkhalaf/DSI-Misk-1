# 2.1.3 - Logical expressions
# Misk Academy Data Science Immersive, 2020

# Logical expressions are how we
# Ask and combine TRUE/FALSE questions

# Asking questions ----
# There a 6 Relational Operators
# Can you list them?


# Plus we have a special case in R:
# !x, where x is a logical vector, give the negation of x
!c(T, F, T, T, T)


# Combining questions ----
# There are 2 typical Logical Operators
# Can you name them?


# There is one more R-specific logical operator
# %in% WITHIN

## Number one thing to remember:
## You will ALWAYS get a logical vector whenever you see a relational or logical operator

# Examples with foo_df: Logical data ----
# All healthy observations

filter( foo_df , healthy == TRUE )

# All unhealthy observations

filter( foo_df , healthy == TRUE )


# Examples with foo_df: Numeric data
# Below quantity 10
foo_df %>%
filter(quantity <= 10)

# Tails (beyond 10 and 20)

foo_df %>%
  filter(quantity > 20 | quantity > 10 )

# Impossible



# Middle (between 10 and 20)

foo_df %>%
  filter(quantity>=10 & quantity<=20)

foo_df %>%
  filter(quantity>=10 , quantity<=20) # an other way to do 
# Meaningless



# What really happened
# We asked two questions:
foo_df$quantity>=10 & foo_df$quantity<=20
# Examples with foo_df: Character data
# NO PATTERN MATCHING so we have to use exact matches
# All heart observations



# All heart and liver observations
# Cheap and easy way:



# What if... our query was in a vector?
query <- c("Heart", "Liver")
# How can we combine many == and |



# to compare, NEVER DO THIS!!!
# This doesn't work:
foo_df %>% 
  filter(tissue == query)
# But this does: i.e. reverse the query
foo_df %>% 
  filter(tissue == rev(query))
# because of lentgh vectoring, if 2 objects in 6 object search you got it man 
foo_df%>% 
  filter(tissue%in%query)
